d "- Hi, I'm Zip!"
d "- Is this Rem's new friend?"
d "I.. don't think so."
d "- Oh, that's too bad."
d "- She might not seem like it, but she might be lonely, too."
d "- Despite her extermination work, she's afraid of killing too many."
d "- But I hear you're not interested in that."
d "How did you end up here?"
d "I travel between her town and Miki's town. I'm probably Rem's only friend."
