d "A girl sits at the table, contrasting sharply with everything around her."
d "Her hair is bright white, and sometimes some of the curls shimmer with rainbow colours."
d "Her almost white eyes look off to the side."
d "She is wearing a warm jacket in three colors: red, blue and green."
d "A white skirt was visible under the jacket and she had white stockings on her feet."
d "As soon as she noticed me, she immediately started to have fun."
