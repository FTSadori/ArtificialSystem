d "The hall is long and shines with golden light on the marble floor."
d "Some girl is waiting for me."
d "She looks dignified, wearing a thin robe with incredibly wide sleeves."
d "Her robe is embroidered with gold threads, and several gold ribbons are woven into her pure black hair."
d "Her hair was carefully tied back, and her eyes were closed..."
d "With only the third eye on her forehead looking straight into my soul."
