Creation and destruction had no limits for them. Some could see into the soul, and some could compress entire worlds into a seed. But their strength pulled them down. The surface under their feet could no longer support them, and we, the weaker creatures, appeared above. Sometimes, looking down, we could see the carved and beautifully decorated roofs of buildings, but the darkness made it impossible to see anything else." ::nobase64

Our buildings are double-layered, and we pour a jelly mass between the glass plates to make the walls opaque.
