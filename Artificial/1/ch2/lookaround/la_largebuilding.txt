d "And in the middle of a large room stands a not very big girl."
d "She is probably the one in charge here."
d "I was able to get a closer look at her."

d "A white shirt and a short skirt under an open green cloak."
d "Her expression was always serious, she was looking away and thinking about something."
d "Also, round glasses only added to her look of severity."
