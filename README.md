### MOVA 4+
The last note applies to **MOVA version 4 and above**, *don't worry if you don't understand what we are talking about, in the future you will understand and it will help you ;)*.  
Start input and output data from register â„–100, this will help you avoid unpredictable behavior, because some variables are created by the compiler, and you can overwrite them.
